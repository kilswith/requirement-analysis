# What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements.
Through a series of well-defined tasks, learners will create a detailed blueprint of the requirement analysis phase for a booking management system. 
This project simulates a real-world development scenario, emphasizing clarity, precision, and structure in defining requirements to set the stage for successful project execution.

# Why is requirement analysis important
* Clarifies Project Goals and Scope
Requirement analysis helps define what the system should do and why it’s being built.
It ensures that developers, designers, and stakeholders have a shared understanding of the project’s objectives.

* Reduces Development Costs and Rework
Identifying and resolving requirement issues early saves time, effort, and money.
It’s much cheaper to correct misunderstandings during the planning stage than after code has been written and tested.

* Ensures High-Quality, User-Focused Systems
Through proper analysis, developers can design systems that meet user needs and business goals effectively.
Clear requirements lead to better functionality, usability, and performance, which means happier end users.
