# What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements.
Through a series of well-defined tasks, learners will create a detailed blueprint of the requirement analysis phase for a booking management system. 
This project simulates a real-world development scenario, emphasizing clarity, precision, and structure in defining requirements to set the stage for successful project execution.

# Why is requirement analysis important
* Clarifies Project Goals and Scope
Requirement analysis helps define what the system should do and why it’s being built.
It ensures that developers, designers, and stakeholders have a shared understanding of the project’s objectives.

* Reduces Development Costs and Rework
Identifying and resolving requirement issues early saves time, effort, and money.
It’s much cheaper to correct misunderstandings during the planning stage than after code has been written and tested.

* Ensures High-Quality, User-Focused Systems
Through proper analysis, developers can design systems that meet user needs and business goals effectively.
Clear requirements lead to better functionality, usability, and performance, which means happier end users.

# Key activities in Requirement Analysis
1. Requirement Gathering
- Involves collecting information about what users and stakeholders expect from the system.
- Common methods include interviews, surveys, observation, and document review.
- The main goal is to understand user needs and project goals clearly.

2. Requirement Elicitation
- Focuses on refining and elaborating the gathered requirements.
- Uses techniques such as brainstorming, prototyping, and focus group discussions.
- Helps uncover hidden or unstated requirements that stakeholders might not initially express.

3. Requirement Documentation
- Converts gathered information into structured documents like the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) or use case diagrams.
- Ensures that all stakeholders have a clear reference point for what the system will do.
- Acts as a foundation for design, development, and testing phases.

4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling
- Involves examining requirements for feasibility, consistency, and completeness.
- May include modeling techniques such as data flow diagrams (DFDs) or use case models to visualize system behavior.
- Helps identify potential conflicts, dependencies, and risks early.

5. Requirement Validation
- Ensures that the documented requirements accurately represent stakeholder needs.
- Includes reviews, walkthroughs, and prototype demonstrations to confirm understanding.
- Prevents costly rework by verifying that the system is being built right from the start.

# Types of Requiremnets
1. Functional Requirements
Functional requirements describe what the system should do — the specific behaviors, functions, and operations it must perform.
They define the core features and interactions that deliver value to users.

Examples:
- Users should be able to create, view, modify, and cancel bookings.
- The system must allow searching for available rooms or services by date and category.
- Admins should be able to add, edit, or remove available slots or resources.
- The system should send booking confirmations and reminders via email or SMS.
- Users should be able to make secure online payments for confirmed bookings.

⚙️ 2. Non-functional Requirements
Non-functional requirements describe how the system should perform, rather than what it does.
They define quality attributes like performance, security, usability, and reliability.

Examples:
- The system should load all pages within 3 seconds under normal network conditions.
- All user data must be encrypted and stored securely in compliance with data protection standards.
- The website should be accessible 24/7 with 99.9% uptime.
- The application must support up to 10,000 concurrent users without performance degradation.
- The user interface should be responsive and mobile-friendly, ensuring smooth navigation on all devices.
